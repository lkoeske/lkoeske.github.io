	<h1>Ava's Dislikes</h1>
	<p>Just as Ava has Interests, she has dislikes and even fears.</a>
		<!-- add dislikes here -->
		<article>
		<h2>Dislikes</h2>
		<h3>Anatomy Class:</h3>
		<img src= "photos/anatomy.png" height= "250" width="200">
		<p> Ava very much hates Anatomy class. I can attest that class is impossible. Low amounts of information are given in class and the tests are so difficult. It is completely valid that she doesn't like this class. To be honest, I can't name anyone who does like this class.</p>
		<h3>Mr. Anticole:</h3>
		<img src="photos/avahate.jpg" height="200" width="250">
		<p>Ava does not like Mr. Anticole. She gave her, her first B in highschool. He decided it would be a great idea to try out a reverse learning classroom on kids who hadn't been to school during covid. His strategy involved very little teaching to say the least. The hate is deserved.</p>

		<h2>Fears:</h2>
		<h3>Snakes</h3>
		<img src="photos/avasnake.jpg" height="250" width="250">
		<p>Ava is so scared of snakes. I have been slowly sending her videos of them to try and break down her fear but i'm not sure how well it has worked. She hates how they coil up and slither around. One of her worst fears is being constricted by one. Another scary scenario for her would be if she felt a snake in her bed. She would freak out!</p>
		<h3>Tickling:</h3>
		<img src="photos/IMG_5507.PNG" height="250" width="200">
		<p>This might be the worst one yet. Ava hates tickling. She is always wary of being tickled as well. If you ever try she will literally beat you up. She kicks, punches, smacks, pinches, and pulls your hair until you have to stop tickling her. She makes sure it wasn't worth it to tickle her. But that just goes to show how scared she is of it.</p>
