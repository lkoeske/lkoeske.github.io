        <p>During the fall Ava has a few favorite activities, or traditions.<br>

        She is always baking. She is super busy all of the time but that doesnt stop her. She is always trying new recipe's(which she never follows) and makes delicious treats for everyone around her. She definitely bakes year-round, but in the fall she specializes in pumpkin flavored treats that also have delicious hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. We have a friend at school who refuses to eat school lunch(L take). He always relies on Ava's baking for nourishment throughout the day. Not only does she bake tasty treats, she also finds way to incorporate more protein or other nutrients to involve some health benefits in her creations.
    </p>
    
    <h2><section id="Tea_section">Drinking Tea</section></h2>
    <!--insert image--><img src="photos/avatea.jpg" height="275" width="300"></center>
    <p>this is another obsession that gets crazy in the fall. There is nothing better to her on a fall day then sitting down with a nice, warm cup of tea. Although what is funny is that she can make a single cup of tea last for the whole day! She really loves tea but she does very well at portioning it out throughout the day (also known as forgetting about it then being happy when she finds cold tea on her desk hours later). Nevertheless, she does enjoy a nice cup of tea on a cold fall day. I can paint the picture in my mind, looking out the window with tea in hand, wrapped up in blankets, watching the brightly colored leaves drift through the air and to the ground. </p>


    <h2><section id="Farm_section">Trips to "The Farm"</section></h2>
    <!--insert image-->
    <p>This is another nostalgic fall experience for her. The run down of it is that her family owns a house and some property down on the border of <a href= "https://www.pa.gov/">PA.</a> I have now been a few times myself and I have always found it fun and relaxing. Basically there is a house with a large front room covered floor to ceiling in windows. It has a warm, authentic fireplace that is capable of heating the entire house by itself. There are two large couches that face each other. There is also a large tv mounted on the ledge above the fireplace. This house is surrounded by a few acres of land as well as a pond that is nearby. It is very secluded which plays a big part in the relaxing element. Ava's nostalgia comes from the memories she made there as a kid. Riding quads, getting dirty in the process. The best part now, that I think we would both agree on, is the singular restaurant nearby. <a href= "http://www.braddocksinn.com/menu">"General Braddocks."</a> This is a diner that just has the most absolutely wonderful breakfast and lunch foods imaginable. I always stuff myself full of as much food as I can get. Last time we were all there I ate my own meal as well as half of everyone elses. Just to wrap things up we hope to go again this year by ourselves, as well as some of Ava's close friends.</p>

     <p>Another huge thing for her is dressing up. We have only been out together once for Halloween. We were Danny Phantom and Sam, from the Nickolodeon show of the same name. We went to a few parties since we are too old to trick-or-treat now and it was quite a lot of fun. This year she has been stressing out like crazy trying to figure out what we are going to be. She is obsessed with being <a href= "https://teentitans.fandom.com/wiki/Raven">Raven from "Teen Titans".</a>I have been consistent in not wanting to paint my skin green to be beast boy. A few other suggestions have been, Dunkan and Gwen from Total Drama, Robin and Starfire from Teen Titans, Charlies Angles, and my contribution, L and Ryuk from Death Note. Despite the different options we are having a hard time choosing. We wanted to coordinate with her friends but it doesnt seem like its going to happen.</p>
