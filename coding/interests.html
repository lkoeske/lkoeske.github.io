        <img src="photos/avainterest.JPG" height= "225" width= "225">
        <p>Ava has many interests that spark fire in others. I find it amazing how pationate she can be. It often makes me really happy to watch her eat food that she likes and spend time with her when she's talking about fall weather.</p></center>

        <h2>Interest #1: Fall</h2>
        <!--insert fall picture here-->
		<img src="photos/fallpicture.jpg" height="225" width="225">
        <p>Ava has been excited about fall weather for months now. Most people in the summer are happy to be at the beach in the nice warm air, but Ava cant wait until sweater weather sneakes up on us. She loves the way the trees look as the molt their leaves.<br>

        <h2>Interest #2: Cats!</h2>
		<img src="photos/IMG_7526.PNG" height="225" width="225">
        <p>Ava is obsessed with cats. She especially likes the ones that are up to no good. They look evil! Even then ava just can't get enough when it comes to cats on social media, shes says she wants every one she sees!<br>

        <h2>Interest #3: Working Out</h2>
		<img src="photos/avagym.jpg" height="225" width="225">
		<p>Ava has been very good and consistent at working out for years now. Even if she has a streak where she hasnt gone for a week or two, she gets right back at it. Her resting heart rate is in the 50's! That is from hard work and dedication if i've ever seen in.<br>
